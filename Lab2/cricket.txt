With billions for television rights and millions for salaries, the Indian Premier League of cricket is a big-time league in every respect. But now it is being disrupted in a most low-tech manner: by protesting, drought-stricken farmers. And maybe by snakes.
For decades, two Indian states, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, have vigorously disputed water rights to the Cauvery River. Pressed by drought conditions, farmers in Tamil Nadu have recently increased their demands for more water.
The farmers decided that to get publicity for their cause, the best target was the high-profile I.P.L., an 11-year-old league that has been a smashing success, drawing top players and viewers from all over the world.
Now protests at the home opener of the Chennai Super Kings, based in the capital of Tamil Nadu, have caused the team’s six remaining home games to be moved to Pune, 600 miles away.
The matches had to be shifted out of Chennai, as police had said that they were unable to provide security in the prevailing situation,” I.P.L. Chairman Rajeev Shukla told reporters.
There were protests inside and outside the stadium for the opening home game in Chennai on Tuesday. Farmers were joined by activists and some film stars.
The police closed roads to the stadium, and at least 20 protesters were arrested. Inside, a pair of shoes was thrown on the field, although no harm was done, and the South African player Faf du Plessis amiably tossed the shoes back in the crowd.
Saravanan Hari, a devoted Super Kings fan known for painting himself yellow for games, was reportedly attacked and struck by protesters outside the stadium before the game. “I don’t know why they wanted to hit me. They just hit me and ran away,” he told The News Minute. He said he sympathized with the cause, but wanted the games to be played. “We are CSK fans; we are also Tamilians. We also want TN to get Cauvery water. But we are for the cricket match. Theaters are running movies. Will you stop it?”
